# This scripts takes a docker image that already contains the GRL dependencies, copies the local source code in and
# uploads that image into GCR. Once in GCR the docker image can be used for development.

# Each time you update the base image via a "bash docker_build_dependency_image.sh", there will be a slow upload process
# (minutes). However, if you are simply changing local code and not updating dependencies, uploading just takes a few seconds.

# Script to buid a GRL base image locally, example cmd is:
# bash build_docker.sh

Docker does not appear usable from this account and the build would prompt for a password.

Run the build with sufficient privileges (will prompt): sudo bash build_docker.sh
On Linux, add your user to the docker group so sudo isn't required (you must re-login):
  sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER" && newgrp docker
